libnss-tacplus (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added config variable "timeout" to limit time attempting to
    connect to non-responding TACACS server.
  * Added config variable "exclude_users" in /etc/tacplus_nss
    to avoid looking up "local" user accounts via TACACS servers.  This
    improves overall system performance for local users, and avoids significant
    delays when a TACACS server is unreachable.
  * Fixed issues with ordering of multiple servers and secrets in config files.
    libraries can connect to a TACACS+ server without being tacacs aware.
  * Improved debugging messages.
  * Minor corrections to Copyright and licensing
  * Added vrf config variable, so NSS lookups work correctly$
  * During login, send remote add IP address in AUTH request
  * Configuration files should automatically be reparsed
    if they change, for long-lived programs and daemons that use NSS.
  * Added user_homedir config variable to allow per-user
    home directories (unless per-command authorization is enabled)

libnss-tacplus (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve debugging on server connections, and always try all
    servers in list until successful response, in case different
    servers have different user databases.

  * Add min_uid and exclude_users config variables to avoid TACACS+
    lookups of local users, for robustness and performance.

libnss-tacplus (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial version with NSS lookups for tacacs users using mapping
    Works with modified libpam-tacplus to authenticate TACACS+ users
    without local passwd entries, mapping them to tacacs0..15 based on
    TACACS privilege level.
